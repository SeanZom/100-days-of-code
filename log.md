# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sep 28, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Got a new feature of CSS3 - Scroll Snap

**Thoughts:** This latest feature can make the web page works as ViewPager in a super concise way, moreover, it's pure CSS code! [Note: check browser compatibility before using]

### Day 2: Sep 29, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: The weird vertical padding

**Thoughts:** Vertical padding is relative to element's width not height. For example, `padding-top: 50%;` does not add 50% of the original *height* of the element as padding, but 50% of the *width* of the *parent* element
